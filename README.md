 Versioned Collection & Frugal Skiplist Project

 
Winter Semester 2025/2026 — NoSQL Project

---

## 📌 1. Project Goal

The goal of this project is to implement a **multi-versioned data structure** that supports:

- **Appending values** with a version (timestamp)  
- **Querying the visible value** at a given timestamp  
- **Two storage modes**:
  - In-memory (volatile)
  - Persistent (KVStore + JSON)
- **Two data structures**:
  1. Simple linked list (VLinkedList)
  2. Frugal Skiplist (optimized version list)

---

## 📌 2. Implemented Classes

### ✅ 2.1 `VLinkedList<P>`
Simple in-memory version list:
- New versions become the head.
- Linked list sorted by timestamp (newest → oldest).
- `findVisible()` walks the list linearly.

### Complexity
- Append: **O(1)**
- FindVisible: **O(n)**

---

### ✅ 2.2 `BackedVLinkedList<P>`
Persistent version list stored in a **KVStore**:
- Stores nodes as JSON via Jackson.
- Uses `Serializer<P>` for payloads.
- Each node keeps:
  - timestamp  
  - payload  
  - nextK  

---

### ✅ 2.3 `FrugalSkiplist<P>`
Optimized in-memory skiplist version list:
- Each node has:
  - `level`
  - `vRidgy` skip pointer
  - `next` pointer
- Fast search using skip pointers.

### Complexity
- Append: **O(log n)**  
- FindVisible: **O(log n)** average

---

### ✅ 2.4 `BackedFrugalSkiplist<P>`
Persistent version of FrugalSkiplist:
- Stores node records in KVStore.
- JSON fields:
  - timestamp  
  - payload  
  - level  
  - nextK  
  - vSkip  

---

## 📌 3. Supporting Components

### ✔ `Serializer<T>`
Converts values to/from String.  
Used for storing payloads inside JSON.

### ✔ `KVStore`
Simple key-value storage interface (`put`, `get`).

### ✔ `FlushableKVStore`
Extends KVStore with `flushDB()`.

### ✔ `InMemoryKVStore`
Custom HashMap-based KVStore created for testing.

## 📌 4. Manual Testing (ManualTest.java)

We manually tested all 4 structures.

Inserted versions:

```
("ten", 2)
("five", 7)
("ten", 8)
```

Tested:

```
findVisible(1)   = null
findVisible(2)   = ten
findVisible(6)   = ten
findVisible(7)   = five
findVisible(8)   = ten
findVisible(100) = ten
```

All implementations returned correct results.

---

## 📌 5. Jackson Integration

We added these JARs (same version):

```
jackson-core-2.15.0.jar
jackson-annotations-2.15.0.jar
jackson-databind-2.15.0.jar
```

Used for serializing NodeRecord objects to JSON.

## 📌 7. Next Steps

- Integrate into VersionListFactory  
- Implement MultiVersionMap  
- Benchmark performance  
- Add higher-level MVCC logic if required

## 8.  Task 1.3 – A Simple Multi-Version Map
- In this task, we implement a simple MultiVersionMap using a Java TreeMap that maps keys to versioned data structures. 
- Each key is associated with a VersionList storing multiple versions of a payload. The MultiVersionMap supports:
  - inserting new versions 
  - retrieving the visible version at a given timestamp 
  - performing range snapshots 
  - running full-range snapshots 
  - The task consists of sub-parts 1.3(a), 1.3(b), and 1.3(c).
  
--- 
 ##   📌 1.3(a) – Implementation of BackedSimpleMVM<K,P>
1. We implemented:

 _BackedSimpleMVM<K extends Comparable<? super K>, P>_
    which implements the MultiVersionMap interface.
    
2. Internal Structure

-Uses a TreeMap<K, VersionList<P>> to maintain keys in sorted order.
Uses a VersionListFactory<P> to create appropriate version lists:_

* BackedVLinkedList<P>
* BackedFrugalSkiplist<P>
* Stores data in a KVStore (here: InMemoryKVStore). 
* Maintains a global version counter, starting at version 1, incremented at each append.

  Implemented Methods
    - long append(K key, P payload)
    Assigns the next version number and appends the payload to the appropriate VersionList.
    Map.Entry<K,P> get(K key, long timestamp)
    Returns the version of the record visible at timestamp t.
    Iterator<Map.Entry<K,P>> rangeSnapshot(...)
    Returns visible versions for keys within [low, high].
    Iterator<Map.Entry<K,P>> snapshot(long timestamp)
    Returns visible versions for all keys.

## 📌 1.3(b) – Test Class Completion
We completed the provided Test.java as required.
✔ Steps Implemented
*     Read the dataset test_data.csv using the provided readData() method.
*     Insert all entries into two MultiVersionMaps:
*     one using BackedVLinkedList
*     one using BackedFrugalSkiplist
*     Perform the required Range-Snapshot:
*     Range: KEY002 → KEY004  (inclusive)
*     Timestamp: 20
    

* Correct Output (matches assignment)
    From the project PDF, the expected visible versions are:
    _KEY002 = Payload[title=Some Title for KEY002, comment=Change 3 for key KEY002, timestamp=19]
    KEY003 = Payload[title=Some Title for KEY003, comment=Change 4 for key KEY003, timestamp=20]
    KEY004 = Payload[title=Some Title for KEY004, comment=Change 3 for key KEY004, timestamp=13]_

    Our implementation produced exactly this output for both:
    _BackedSimpleMVM + BackedVLinkedList
    BackedSimpleMVM + BackedFrugalSkiplist_
    thus validating correctness.

## 1.3(c) – Runtime Benchmarking

We extended the Test class to benchmark both MultiVersionMap variants using benchmark_data.csv (~500k entries). 
We measured:

1. Insertion Time
    Average measured over 2 runs:
                VersionList Type	       Avg Insertion Time
                 BackedVLinkedList	        ~0.39 s
                 BackedFrugalSkiplist	    ~4.86 s
    
Explanation:
    Linked list append is O(1) → faster.
    Skiplist append is O(log n) → slower due to multiple levels and pointer maintenance.
    
2. Snapshot Performance
        We executed full-range snapshots at timestamps:
        10, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000,
        10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 500,000
        
Results (typical averages):
    Timestamp	 VLinkedList (ns)	 FrugalSkiplist (ns)
    10	         380M	                 22M
    100	        406M	                 24M
    500	        401M	                 24M
    1,000	      421M	                 25M
    5,000	      381M	                 23M
    …	…	…
    500,000	    ~650k	              ~790k
    

✔ Explanation
    Linked List snapshot is O(n) → slow
    Frugal Skiplist snapshot is O(log n) → much faster
    At very high timestamps, early termination leads to smaller times for both

## 📌 1.4 – VWeaver MultiVersionMap (Optimized Range Snapshot)
In this task, we extend our MultiVersionMap implementation by adopting the VWeaver technique, 
which accelerates range-based time travel queries by adding a cross-key skip pointer called kRidgy.
This is the most advanced part of the project and demonstrates how multi-versioned data structures can be optimized across multiple keys.

## 📌 1.4(a) – Implementation of BackedVWeaverMVM<K,P>
We implemented the class:
BackedVWeaverMVM<K extends Comparable<K>, P>
which also implements MultiVersionMap<K,P>.

✔ Internal Structure
1. Uses a sorted TreeMap<K, BackedFrugalSkiplist<P>>
2. Uses BackedFrugalSkiplist nodes extended with:
3. kRidgyKey → cross-pointer to next key’s skiplist
4. vRidgyKey → vertical skip pointer (from Task 1.2)
5. Tracks a global timestamp counter (same as Task 1.3)

✔ The New Addition: kRidgy Pointer

1. Whenever we append a new version for key K:
2. We insert normally into the skiplist (same as Task 1.2).
3. We fetch the next higher key: nextKey = map.higherKey(K)
4. We compute the visible version of nextKey at the same timestamp.
5. We store the pointer to that node inside the new node’s kRidgyKey field.
6. This gives us a shortcut into the next skiplist.

## 📌 1.4(a) – Implementation of BackedVWeaverMVM<K,P>

BackedVWeaverMVM<K extends Comparable<K>, P>
which also implements MultiVersionMap<K,P>.

5. We store the pointer to that node inside the new node’s kRidgyKey field.
6. This gives us a shortcut into the next skiplist.


## 📌 1.4(c) – Theoretical Improvement for Range-Snapshot Using Parent Pointers

Theoretical Improvement
If we had access to the internal nodes of the search tree, and each node stored a pointer to its parent,
then we could compute the next key in sorted order (the in-order successor) without performing a search.

The successor of a node in a binary search tree can be found using only pointer navigation:
    Case 1 — Node has a right child
        Move to the leftmost node in the right subtree.
    Case 2 — Node has no right child
        Repetitively follow the parent pointer upward until the node is a left child of its parent.
        That parent is the next key.

This computation touches only a few pointers and therefore works in O(1) amortized time, not O(log N).

✔ Why this speeds up Range-Snapshot
The VWeaver algorithm already reduces skiplist traversal cost using kRidgy and vRidgy pointers, 
but moving from key to key is still expensive.
Replacing higherKey() with an O(1) successor computation would make the horizontal traversal across keys effectively free.
